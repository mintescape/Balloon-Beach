# Balloon-Beach
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for my first game built in Unity - Balloon Beach, an addictive endless vertical auto scroller!

In this game, your goal is to control a red ball that is endlessly rolling vertically, while avoiding spiky obstacles to rack up points. The core loop of the game is 
simple yet challenging - control the ball's movement by pressing and moving your finger across the screen to the left or right. With every passing obstacle, you earn 
points, and for every 10 points, the speed of the ball increases.

But beware! Along the way, you must avoid the spiky obstacles at all costs, or else you will have to start the game over from zero points. However, I've added a twist 
to keep the game interesting - collect gold coins that are scattered throughout the game to buy yourself back to life anytime you die. The price to buy a life starts at
10 and increases every time you die or reach every 30 points, adding an extra layer of challenge and strategy to the game.

My game is designed based on a Udemy course by David McDonald, but I added the speed up, coins and life systems myself to provide a fast-paced, addictive experience for 
gamers of all ages. It features smooth and responsive controls, as well as pleasingly simple art style and sound effects that enhance the overall experience.

So what are you waiting for? Download the game now, and see how long you can go!
